Python Challenge

This is an assignment I completed for the UCSD Extension Data Science Bootcamp. This assignment ensured my ability to create loops, variables, loading files, printing to terminal, and to write the output of the code to a text file. This was a great inroduction to Python for me and I had a good time learning how to put this all together.

The PyBank part of this project required writing variables as a blank list, then appending the list with data pulled from a CSV file. Using a for loop to go through each row of the CSV file and add correspnding data to each emply list.

For the PyPoll part of this project I used Pandas to create a dataframe od the CSV file. Visualizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame helps me better remember the data and helps me find what I am looking for faster. PyPoll simply runs an averaging formula on the number of votes cast for each candidate, then prints out the percentage to the terminal and a .txt file.

Thank you for reading my read me!
