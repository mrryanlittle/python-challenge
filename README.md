# Python Challenge

This is the first assignment I completed for the [UCSD Extension Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/). This assignment ensured my ability to write loops, variables, loading files, printing to terminal, and to write the output of the code to a text file. This was a great inroduction to Python for me and a real motivation to keep moving forward with Python language and the UCSD Extension program. I had a good time learning how to put this all together.

## Pybank

The PyBank portion of this project required creating blank lists to be appended with a for loop which iterated through the csv file. The data found in the for loop was then applied to functions held in different variables.

This data was then printed to the terminal and written to a new file FinancialAnalysis.txt

## PyPoll

For the PyPoll part of this project I used Pandas to create a dataframe of the CSV file. Visualizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame helps me better remember the data and helps me find what I am looking for faster.

After importing the dedependcies, pandas and csv, PyPoll simply runs an averaging formula on the number of votes cast for each candidate. PyPoll then prints out the percentage to the terminal and writes to a .txt file.
